# Samples

This is where we will try and add sample projects.

## myoddweb.directorywatcher.sample

Very simple sample to output all the changes to your directory using `MyOddWeb.DirectoryWatcher` as a nuget package

### The package ...

```powershell
    install-package MyOddWeb.DirectoryWatcher
```

## myoddweb.directorywatcher.sample.ref

Same as the `myoddweb.directorywatcher.sample` but it uses project references.

It makes it easier to test/debug, (and generally see what is going on)
